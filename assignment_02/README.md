Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to learn about two clustering algorithms that can be used to
perform anomaly detection and act as a simple Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS).

Description
You and your team will develop two anomaly detectors:
● k means, and
● Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN).

You are NOT allowed to use any third-party libraries (e.g. scikit-learn, etc.) to implement the
clustering algorithms. Other usage of third-party libraries is fine, and it is in-fact recommended
that you use libraries to perform some operations such as dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA,
etc.) and distance calculations (e.g., euclidean distance, etc.).
