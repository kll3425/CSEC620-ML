"""
(3.1) k-Means
● Use k-Means clustering to identify the centroids of the clusters in the normal traffic
training set.
● Select a distance threshold value, t.
● For each test sample, find the cluster centroid to which the sample is closest using a
distance function (e.g. Euclidean distance). If the distance is less than your threshold
value t, then classify the sample as normal. If it is greater than your threshold value t,
then classify the sample as anomalous.
